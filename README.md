# Space Handshakes â€“ Hackathon â€™25 Submission

A real-time satellite communication simulation tool developed using React and TypeScript.  
This project was built for Hackathon â€™25 in response to the challenge of visualizing orbital handshakes between a beacon satellite and a relay constellation in low Earth orbit.

---

## Overview 

**Space Handshakes** is a real-time simulation tool for modeling inter-satellite communication events. It simulates a beacon satellite in a customizable low Earth orbit (LEO) and calculates communication windows and outages with a relay constellation (e.g., Iridium) over a 24-hour period. The app visualizes:

- Orbital motion  
- Communication cone geometry  
- Real-time intersection events (handshakes)  
- Time periods without coverage (blackouts)  

The simulation simplifies orbital mechanics while preserving geometric accuracy for coverage modeling and intersection analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **React** + **TypeScript** â€“ frontend architecture and user interaction  
- **Vite** â€“ fast dev builds and hot reload  
- **Node.js** + **npm** â€“ scripting and dependency management  
- **CSS** â€“ clean UI styling, custom themed

## Key Features

- Choose between **Sun-synchronous** and **Non-polar** orbit modes  
- Customizable satellite parameters:
  - Altitude (in km)  
  - Local Solar Time (LST) â€“ for sun-synchronous orbits  
  - Inclination â€“ for non-polar orbits  
- 24-hour discrete simulation  
- Real-time updates of:
  - Number of successful handshakes  
  - Duration and count of blackouts  
- Component-based, modular frontend for future expansion

## Simulation Parameters
-Orbit Type       : Sun-synchronous
-Altitude         : 500 km
-Local Solar Time : 12:00 PM
These parameters define a beacon satellite in a sun-synchronous LEO orbit that passes the equator at 12:00 PM local solar time during its descending node.

## Simulation Outputs
-Total Handshakes       : 22
-Total Blackouts        : 22
-Total Blackout Time    : 23.20 hours
-Average Blackout Time  : 1.05 hours
-Communication Uptime   : 3.3%

**Interpretation:**
- The beacon is able to communicate with the Iridium constellation for only **3.3%** of the time.
- The satellite experiences 22 separate blackout periods with an average duration of just over 1 hour.
- This low uptime reflects the limited overlap between the beacon's horizontal antennas and the relay constellationâ€™s coverage zones, highlighting the value of strategic orbit configuration and relay placement.

## How It Works

At each timestep in the 24-hour simulation:
1. **Orbital Positioning**: Satelliteâ€™s position is calculated using Keplerian motion equations simplified for circular LEO.
2. **Cone Modeling**: Antennas modeled as fixed-angle conesâ€”beacon has two opposing horizon-aligned cones; Iridium has downward-pointing cones.
3. **Intersection Test**: Geometry engine checks cone overlaps to detect handshakes.
4. **Blackout Detection**: If no relay is within communication range, a blackout is recorded.

All computation is done in-browser and updates in real-time.
